## Style guide for contributors

For better experience, we recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - we have a list of recommended extensions to prevent many common errors, improve code and save time.

We use [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/). It fixes basic mistakes on every file saving.

And please install [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform#how-to-install) with all its dependencies. It checks all changed files when you run `git commit` for more complex problems and tries to fix them for you.
